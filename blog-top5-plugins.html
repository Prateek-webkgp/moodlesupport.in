<p>
Moodle is powerful on its own — but plugins turn it into a full-featured teaching platform. Here are 5 plugins I’ve personally used and recommend for institutes running Moodle for hundreds or even thousands of students.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#ffb347;">1. BigBlueButton (BBB)</h2>
<p>
This plugin integrates live classes directly into Moodle. Faculty can start virtual classes, students can join instantly, and sessions can be recorded. I’ve configured this for 5000+ users and tuned the server settings for smooth performance.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#ffb347;">2. Attendance</h2>
<p>
Used to help faculty track presence across lectures. It ties directly into course activities, allows grading based on attendance, and supports CSV export. I’ve set this up in programs where physical presence is mandatory.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#ffb347;">3. Questionnaire</h2>
<p>
I use this for student feedback, feedback forms during onboarding, and quick academic polls. It’s flexible, supports Likert scales, and doesn’t mess with the grading system like Quiz sometimes does.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#ffb347;">4. Custom Certificate</h2>
<p>
This plugin lets you design branded, personalized certificates triggered by course completion. I’ve deployed this with site-wide templates and trained faculty to use it on their own.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#ffb347;">5. Transcript Viewer Block (Custom)</h2>
<p>
I developed a custom block to let admins and faculty view grade data filtered by email, batch, or cohort. It supports export and has saved hours of manual spreadsheet work.
</p>

<hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, #ff4d4d88, transparent); margin: 30px 40px;">

<p>
These plugins improve the teaching workflow, reduce support tickets, and help faculty stay focused on content rather than technicalities.
